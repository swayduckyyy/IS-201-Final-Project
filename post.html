                <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">

                        <p>Most everyone in their lives has encountered a piano. They probably sat down and tried it once or twice. Many people have even taken lessons or tried to learn a song online or by ear. Even if they haven't tried to play it, they have definitely heard it, whether it was in a pop song, in a friend's home, or at a house party, nearly everyone across the world has heard the beautiful music that emanates from the keys of a piano.</p>
                        <p>Playing styles vary, though. From classical, baroque, and romantic music, to the modern and contemporary compositions of our times, the variety of music we see in just solo piano performance is incredible.</p>
                        <p>What has been the most important development in the use of the piano.</p>
                        <p>Many experience a plethora of emotions when they hear music played on the keys of a piano. That's how it is for me. Many many songs bring me feelings of peace or nostalgia.</p>
                        <p>For those who have heard and played the music of the soul on a keyboard can appreciate it. The differences in opinions and preferences tend to divide, but they don't need to.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Culminating Instrument</h2>
                        <p>Within in the realm of music and instrumentation, nothing quite compares to the sound of a piano being played well. In the words of Kenneth Miller, “The piano is able to communicate the subtlest universal truths by means of wood, metal, and vibrating air.”</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">The beautiful music that can be made isn't completely due to the nature of the instrument, however. As one piano enthusiast said, “A piano is more than an instrument; it is a sanctuary where emotions find their voice and melodies become timeless echoes." It's not the piano, but the player.</blockquote>
                        <p>The continued creation of music with the piano is not an individual endeavor or an expiring effort, the writing, rewriting, and interpretation of music on the piano is an ongoing process that will almost certainly continue for centuries.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Sky's the Limit</h2>
                        <p>“There is no feeling, except the extremes of fear and grief, that does not find relief in music.” ― George Eliot. With the infinite number and kinds of experiences and emotions that humans have, there is no limit to the music that can be made by the human soul. One of the best places that people create that expression, is the piano.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/withmic.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">“Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination and life to everything.” ― Plato</span>
                        <p>The only limitation? The imagination. “Music expresses that which cannot be put into words and that which cannot remain silent.” - Victor Hugo.</p>
                        <p>"Color is the keyboard, the eyes are the harmonies, the soul is the piano with many strings. The artist is the hand that plays, touching one key or another, to cause vibrations in the soul." - Wassily Kandinsky</p>
